Automation of symbolic PDE analysis with Wolfram Mathematica

Abstract: Many symbolic computations and manipulations required in the analysis of partial di er- ential equations (PDE) or systems of PDEs are tedious and error-prone. These computations arise when determining conservation laws, entropies or integral identities, which are essential tools for the study of PDEs. Here, we discuss a new Mathematica package for the symbolic analysis of PDEs that automate multiple tasks, saving time and e ort. The package contains the following functionalities:
- generation of polynomials invariant with respect to di erent symmetry groups,
- simpli cation of integral quantities by integration by parts and null Lagrangian cleaning,
- computing general forms of expressions by integration by parts,
-  nding equivalent forms of an integral expression that are simpler or more symmetric form,
- determining necessary and su cient conditions on the coe cients for the positivity of a given symbolic expression.
Using this package, we can simplify integral identities,  nd conserved and dissipated quantities of time- dependent PDE or system of PDEs.
